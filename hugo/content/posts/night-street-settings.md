## Night Street Photography Settings

Low-light urban environments are perfect for creative storytelling. Use available lighting like street lamps, neon signs, or storefronts to illuminate subjects.

- **ISO**: 1600–3200
- **Aperture**: f/1.8 – f/2.8
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/60s or faster to avoid motion blur
- **White Balance**: Tungsten or Auto

📸 **ShutterCoach Tip**: Embrace the grain. High ISO is okay if it means capturing the moment. Shoot in RAW for better post-processing flexibility.
