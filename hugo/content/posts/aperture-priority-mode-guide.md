## Aperture Priority Mode Guide

Aperture Priority (A or Av) mode allows you to control depth of field while letting your camera automatically select the proper shutter speed.

### Ideal for:
- **Portraits**: Use wider apertures (f/2.8–f/4)
- **Landscapes**: Use narrower apertures (f/8–f/11)

This mode is perfect for beginners learning how aperture affects sharpness, blur, and exposure.

📸 **ShutterCoach Tip**: Set ISO to Auto to reduce exposure balancing complexity when you're learning.
