## Tips for Shooting Action in Bright Light

Outdoor sports, wildlife, or kids at play in midday sun require specific settings to freeze motion while avoiding overexposure:

- **ISO**: 100â€“200
- **Aperture**: f/4â€“f/5.6
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/1000s or faster
- **Focus Mode**: Continuous AF (AF-C)

ðŸ“¸ **Tip**: Use burst mode and track your subject through the viewfinder. Pre-focus zones where action is expected.
