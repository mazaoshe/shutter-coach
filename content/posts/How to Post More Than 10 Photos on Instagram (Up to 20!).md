Do you know you can now post **more than 10 photos on Instagram**?  
In the past, Instagram only allowed a maximum of 10 photos or videos in one carousel post. But with the latest update, you can upload up to **20 photos and videos in a single post**.  

This is great news if you want to share an entire trip, an event, or a photo dump without splitting it into multiple posts. Let me show you how it works, step by step.

## Step 1: Open Instagram and Tap the Plus Icon
Open the Instagram app, then tap on the profile icon in the **bottom right corner**. Next, click on the **‚Äú+‚Äù icon** at the top.

## Step 4: Edit and Share
Once you‚Äôve selected your photos and videos, you can rearrange their order, add filters, or write a caption. Finally, tap **Share** and your post will be live with all 20 images/videos.

## Quick Tips
