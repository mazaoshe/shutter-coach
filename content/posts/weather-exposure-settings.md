## How Weather Affects Exposure Settings

Weather dramatically influences how much light enters your camera, impacting all three exposure settings.

| Weather | EV Estimate | ISO | Aperture | Shutter Speed |
|--------|-------------|-----|----------|----------------|
| Sunny | EV 15 | 100 | f/16 | 1/125s |
| Cloudy | EV 12 | 200 | f/8 | 1/60s |
| Overcast | EV 10 | 400 | f/5.6 | 1/60s |
| Foggy/Rainy | EV 8 | 800 | f/4 | 1/30s |

ðŸ“¸ **Tip**: Watch for light direction and color temperature shiftsâ€”weather affects not only exposure but mood and tone.
