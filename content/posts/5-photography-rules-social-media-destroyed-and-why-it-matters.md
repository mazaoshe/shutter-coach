## 5 Photography Rules Social Media Destroyed (And Why It Matters)

### 1. The Rule of Thirds: From Grid to Chaos

The rule of thirds was photography's golden rule for over a century. Divide your frame into nine equal parts, place your subject on the intersections, and voilà—perfect composition. But Instagram's square format and TikTok's vertical videos shattered this rule. Centered compositions now dominate, and algorithms reward unexpected placements that grab attention. 

**Tip for Beginners:** Experiment with centered and off-center compositions. Test what works best for your audience—sometimes breaking the rule creates more engagement.

### 2. Perfect Exposure: When "Wrong" Looks Right

Traditional photography demanded flawless exposure—no blown highlights or crushed shadows. But social media filters like Instagram's "Nashville" made overexposed and high-contrast images trendy. Mobile screens and compression algorithms further blurred the line between "technically correct" and "visually striking."

**Tip for Beginners:** Don’t obsess over perfect exposure. Use high-contrast edits or filters to make your photos pop on small screens.

### 3. Natural Skin Tones: The Rise of Digital Fantasy

Accurate skin tones were once a hallmark of professional photography. Now, apps like Facetune and TikTok filters normalize extreme retouching, creating unrealistic beauty standards. Audiences often prefer filtered skin over natural tones.

**Tip for Beginners:** If you’re shooting portraits, ask clients about their retouching preferences. Some may want a natural look, while others expect social media-ready edits.

### 4. Image Quality: Pixels Don’t Always Matter

High-resolution cameras and meticulous editing used to define pro work. But social media compression reduces even the best images to low-quality JPEGs. Audiences often engage more with "lo-fi" aesthetics that feel authentic.

**Tip for Beginners:** Focus on bold compositions and colors that survive compression. A great idea beats technical perfection on platforms like Instagram.

### 5. Originality: Why Trends Beat Creativity

Photography once prized originality, but social media algorithms favor familiar, trend-driven content. Replicating popular styles often garners more likes than unique perspectives.
