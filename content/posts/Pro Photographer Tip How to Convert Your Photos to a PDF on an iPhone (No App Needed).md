As photographers, we're constantly capturing moments, from client shoots to personal projects. The ability to quickly organize and share our work is crucial. Sometimes, a single PDF file is the most professional and convenient way to present a collection of images—whether it's a contact sheet for a client, a portfolio for an art director, or a simple proof.

Did you know you can convert a selection of photos into a single PDF file directly on your iPhone or iPad, without downloading a single extra app? This built-in iOS feature is a game-changer for streamlining your workflow.

## Why a PDF Is a Photographer's Best Friend

PDF stands for Portable Document Format, and it’s the gold standard for professional document sharing. For photographers, its benefits are especially valuable:

- **Maintains Image Order and Layout:** A PDF keeps your images in the exact order and layout you choose, ensuring your visual story is told correctly.
    
- **Professional Presentation:** A single PDF looks more polished and organized than sending a dozen individual image files.
    
- **Universal Compatibility:** You can be confident your clients and collaborators can open the file on any device, from a desktop to a tablet, without a hitch.
    
- **Secure Sharing:** You can password-protect PDFs to share sensitive or unapproved images securely.
    
- **Simplified Client Proofing:** Create a quick contact sheet for your clients to review and select their favorite shots.
