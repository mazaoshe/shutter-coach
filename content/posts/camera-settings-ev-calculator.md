## Camera Settings & EV Calculator

EV (Exposure Value) helps photographers understand how ISO, aperture, and shutter speed interact to achieve proper exposure.

### Common EV examples:
- **EV 15**: Bright sunlight ‚Üí ISO 100, f/16, 1/125s
- **EV 10**: Cloudy day ‚Üí ISO 400, f/8, 1/60s
- **EV 6**: Indoor ‚Üí ISO 800, f/2.8, 1/15s

ShutterCoach calculates approximate EV based on your local weather and translates it into camera settings tailored for your scene.

üì∏ **ShutterCoach Tip**: Understanding EV helps demystify manual mode. Use the EV range to plan your exposure before even picking up the camera.
