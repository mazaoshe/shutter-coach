## How to Get Natural Portrait Poses Every Time

Capturing natural and engaging portrait poses can be challenging, but with the right techniques, you can transform stiff or awkward shots into powerful images. Professional photographer Karl Taylor shares his insights on avoiding common posing mistakes and achieving relaxed, authentic results. Here’s a breakdown of his top tips:

### 1. Avoid Stiffness with Angled Poses
One of the biggest pitfalls in portrait photography is stiffness, especially in seated business portraits. Taylor emphasizes the importance of angling the subject slightly rather than positioning them square-on to the camera. A subtle turn of the shoulders or a slight lean forward can make a world of difference, conveying confidence and approachability. For example, having the subject rest their hands on a prop, like a chair arm or a table, can eliminate awkward hand placements.

### 2. Use Props for Natural Hand Positions
Awkward hands can ruin an otherwise great portrait. Taylor suggests using props—such as a coffee cup, a book, or even pockets—to give the subject’s hands a natural resting place. This simple trick helps the subject relax and avoids the unnatural "floating hands" effect.

### 3. Create Depth with Shoulder and Head Positioning
To add dimension to your portraits, Taylor recommends angling the shoulders away from the camera while turning the head back toward it. This technique creates a more dynamic and flattering composition, avoiding the confrontational look of a straight-on pose. It’s particularly effective for upper-body portraits.

### 4. Adjust Posture with Studio Tools
For seated poses, small adjustments can significantly improve comfort and posture. Taylor highlights the use of studio blocks or stools to vary the height of knees or feet, ensuring the subject looks relaxed and natural. Avoid overly symmetrical positions—subtle leans and varied limb placements add visual interest.

### 5. Capture Movement with Controlled Techniques
For fashion or dynamic portraits, Taylor shares advanced techniques like marking the floor for jumping or skipping poses. This ensures the model hits the same spot consistently, maintaining focus and lighting. It’s a controlled way to simulate movement without the unpredictability of walking poses.

### Tailor Your Approach to the Subject
Perhaps the most valuable lesson is adapting your direction to the subject’s comfort level. Whether working with a professional model or a nervous client, Taylor advises reading their strengths and adjusting your guidance accordingly. This personalized approach leads to more authentic and compelling portraits.
