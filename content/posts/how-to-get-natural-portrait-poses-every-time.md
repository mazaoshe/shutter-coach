## How to Get Natural Portrait Poses Every Time

Capturing natural and engaging portrait poses can be challenging, but with the right techniques, you can transform stiff or awkward shots into powerful, authentic images. Whether you're shooting corporate headshots, fashion portraits, or casual sessions, these tips will help you guide your subjects into poses that feel effortless and look stunning.

### 1. Avoid Stiffness with Subtle Angles

One of the most common mistakes in portrait photography is posing subjects square-on to the camera, which can make them appear rigid or confrontational. Instead, angle their shoulders slightly away from the camera while turning their head back toward the lens. This creates depth and a more flattering composition. For seated portraits, encourage your subject to lean slightly forward—this small adjustment exudes confidence and authority.

**Example:** For a business portrait, have your subject sit at a 45-degree angle to the camera, with their shoulders turned away but their face directed toward you. This adds dimension and avoids a flat, lifeless look.

### 2. Give Hands a Purpose

Awkward hand placement can ruin an otherwise great portrait. To solve this, provide props or natural resting spots. For example, a seated subject can rest their hands on their knees or hold a pen or notebook. For standing poses, suggest placing one hand in a pocket or lightly touching their collar. These small actions make the pose feel more natural and less staged.

**Example:** In a corporate portrait, have your subject hold a tablet or folder to give their hands something to do. This not only looks professional but also eliminates the "what do I do with my hands?" dilemma.

### 3. Use Props and Studio Tools

Studio blocks, stools, and other tools can help adjust posture and comfort. For seated poses, use a block to elevate one knee slightly, creating a more dynamic and relaxed posture. Avoid overly symmetrical poses—subtle leans and varied limb placements add visual interest.

**Example:** In fashion photography, use a stool to have your model perch on the edge, with one leg extended and the other bent. This creates a sense of movement and elegance.

### 4. Simulate Movement for Dynamic Shots

For full-length portraits, especially in fashion or catalog work, simulate movement to avoid static poses. A simple rocking technique—shifting weight from one foot to the other—can make the pose feel alive without the unpredictability of actual walking. Mark the floor with tape to ensure the model hits the same spot consistently, maintaining focus and lighting.

**Example:** For a dynamic fashion shot, have your model rock back and forth while you capture the motion. This creates a sense of energy and fluidity in the final image.

### 5. Tailor Poses to the Subject’s Comfort

Not everyone is a professional model, so it’s crucial to adapt your direction to the subject’s comfort level. Observe their natural movements and build poses around their strengths. For nervous subjects, start with simple, relaxed poses and gradually introduce more complexity as they become comfortable.

**Example:** If your subject is shy, begin with seated poses where they can rest their hands on their lap. As they relax, transition to standing poses with gentle direction.

### Final Thoughts

Natural portrait poses are about subtlety and adaptability. By focusing on small adjustments—like angling the shoulders, giving hands a purpose, and using props—you can create portraits that feel authentic and engaging. Remember, the best poses often come from making your subject feel at ease, so always prioritize their comfort and confidence.
