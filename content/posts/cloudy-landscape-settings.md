## Cloudy Day Landscape Settings

Cloudy skies offer diffused, even light—perfect for capturing detail-rich landscapes without harsh highlights or shadows. Here's a typical setting guide:

- **ISO**: 200–400
- **Aperture**: f/8 – f/11 (for depth and sharpness)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/60s or tripod-assisted long exposures
- **White Balance**: Cloudy or Auto

📸 **ShutterCoach Tip**: Use clouds to add mood. Long exposures (with tripod) can help create soft, streaked skies.
