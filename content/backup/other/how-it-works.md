## How It Works

ShutterCoach uses a simple but effective method to help photographers select the right camera settings:

1. **Detect Weather Conditions**: The tool fetches local weather and lighting data using public weather APIs.
2. **Scene Selection**: Users choose a scene type (e.g., portrait, landscape, street) that matches their intended shot.
3. **Apply Exposure Logic**: Based on the weather and scene, ShutterCoach calculates the recommended ISO, aperture, and shutter speed using known exposure value (EV) rules.
4. **Return Clear Results**: The tool displays a complete suggestion set for you to adjust your camera quickly and confidently.

### Who Should Use This?
Anyone who:
- Is new to manual camera settings
- Wants to learn how light affects exposure
- Shoots outdoors in varying conditions

### Can I Customize Settings?
Yes! You can manually change ISO priority, aperture priority, or fixed modes depending on your preference.

ShutterCoach aims to be your fast, beginner-friendly assistant to help you capture better photos in any environment.
