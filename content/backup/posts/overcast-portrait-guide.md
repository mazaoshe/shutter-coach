## Overcast Portrait Photography Guide

Cloudy skies act like a giant softbox, offering smooth, flattering light for portraits. Hereâ€™s how to make the most of it:

- **ISO**: 200â€“400
- **Aperture**: f/2.8 â€“ f/4
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/125s or faster
- **White Balance**: Cloudy

ðŸ“¸ **Tip**: Overcast light is perfect for even skin tonesâ€”no need to avoid midday shoots on gray days.
