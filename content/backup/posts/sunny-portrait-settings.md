## Sunny Day Portrait Settings

Shooting portraits under sunny conditions can result in vibrant images with strong contrast and defined shadows. However, harsh light may also cause overexposure and unflattering shadows on the face. Here are the recommended settings:

- **ISO**: 100 (lowest possible for clean images)
- **Aperture**: f/2.8 – f/4 (for smooth background blur)
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/200s or faster
- **White Balance**: Daylight or Auto
- **Focus Mode**: Single-point AF

📸 **ShutterCoach Tip**: Try using a diffuser, reflector, or positioning your subject in open shade for softer lighting. Golden hour is also an ideal time for soft, flattering sunlight.
