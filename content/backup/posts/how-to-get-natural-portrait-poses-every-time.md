## How to Get Natural Portrait Poses Every Time

### 1. Start with Simple Adjustments

Posing doesn’t have to be complicated. Small tweaks can make a big difference. For seated business portraits, avoid stiff, square-on poses. Instead, angle your subject slightly to create a more dynamic look. Use props like chairs or tables to give their hands a natural resting place. This prevents awkward hand positions and adds a relaxed vibe to the shot.

### 2. Master the Lean

A slight forward lean can transform a portrait. It conveys confidence and authority, especially in corporate or professional settings. Ask your subject to lean slightly toward the camera while keeping their back straight. This subtle adjustment avoids stiffness and makes the pose feel more engaging.

### 3. Use Props and Studio Tools

Studio blocks and stools are invaluable for adjusting posture. For example, placing a block under one foot can help your subject relax into a more natural stance. Avoid symmetrical poses—subtle leans and varied limb placements add visual interest. If your subject is seated, adjust the height of their knees to create a more flattering angle.

### 4. Create Depth with Shoulders and Head

Angling the shoulders away from the camera while turning the head back toward it adds depth to your portraits. This technique avoids a confrontational look and makes the composition more engaging. It’s especially useful for upper-body shots, where stiffness can ruin an otherwise great image.

### 5. Capture Movement Naturally

For dynamic shots, simulate movement without the unpredictability of walking poses. Try a "rocking" technique where your subject shifts their weight from one foot to the other. This creates a sense of motion while keeping the pose controlled. For fashion photography, mark the floor to ensure models hit the same spot every time, maintaining consistent lighting and focus.

### 6. Adapt to Your Subject’s Comfort Level

Not everyone is a professional model. Pay attention to your subject’s comfort and strengths. Some people relax when given clear directions, while others prefer a more conversational approach. Tailor your guidance to their personality for authentic, natural-looking results.
