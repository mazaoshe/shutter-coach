## Best Settings for Golden Hour Photography

Golden hourâ€”the warm, soft light shortly after sunrise or before sunsetâ€”is a favorite among photographers for its flattering tones and long shadows.

- **ISO**: 100â€“200
- **Aperture**: f/2.8â€“f/5.6 for portraits, f/8â€“f/11 for landscapes
- **Shutter Speed**: 1/125s or slower depending on movement
- **White Balance**: Cloudy or Shade for warmth

ðŸ“¸ **Tip**: Use lens hoods to reduce flare, and always expose for the highlights to preserve sky color.
