      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic logs</strong>: IP address, browser type, referring page, time and date of access, and navigation paths.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies / local storage</strong>: For session management, preferences, and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics data</strong>: We may use third-party services (e.g., Google Analytics) to gather anonymized usage data.</li>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
